RI neck (suprahyoid)

Clinical notes:
Exotphytic lesion to L) tonsil with associated large L) neck mass/
lymphadenopathy

Technique:
Multiplanar and multisequence imaging has been obtained through the neck,
including pre and post-contrast sequences.

Findings:

There is enhancing mass centred at the left lateral aspect of the left
tongue base, extending to the to left lateral of the pharyngeal wall and
left palatine tonsil, but also extending anteriorly into the posterolateral
tongue.

Associated large centrally necrotic left level 2 nodal mass, measuring up to
5cm. There is evidence of extranodal extension with invasion of the left
sternocleidomastoid muscle and inferior aspect of the left parotid space.
Upper aspect of the left IJV is involved within the tumour and occluded.

Slightly prominent right level II lymph node is equivocal.  No other
suspicious lymph nodes.

Conclusion:

Primary tumour is centred in the left lateral aspect of the tongue base and
lateral oropharyngeal wall, but extends slightly anteriorly to involve the
posterolateral oral tongue.
Large centrally necrotic left level II lymph node with extranodal extension,
with morphology suggestive of oropharyngeal tumour primary.
